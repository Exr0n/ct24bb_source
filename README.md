# ct24bb_source
A capture the flag style game!

The final product had many features, but was lost in the confusion of server swapping. This README serves as a time capsule for some of the highlights of the final product and what happened during the competition. 

When the competition started, many competitors finish the majority of the challenges within the first couple of days. I ended up developing a string of 12 "bonus" challenges to take up the rest of the time alloted. 
These challenges included some interesting ones such as sifting through a multi-gigabyte large text file for the flag, or finding a qr code hidden on under a rock given just a photo of the tree. 
Players formed alliances and ended up completing up to the 11th bonus challenge before the competition ended, and the winner recieved a Rasberry Pi B 3+ (the newest model at the time). 

I additionally added other features to the website after the archive stored here. For example, there was a self updating scoreboard and podium view, as well as a system of announcing advancements.
The progress log page reportedly found its way into the minute-wise lives of many competitors and even the nightmares of some. 

Although the source code for running the website and project has been all but lost, we have a snapshot of the early development phase.
Though we don't have any digital proof of what CT24bb was, the memories will stick with those who participated long into the future.
Thank you, everyone, and may this serve as a reminder: always double check before you delete.
